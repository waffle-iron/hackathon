Create the new generation Mixmo with fun

Mixmo is a quick letters game.
The letter tiles are all in the middle of the table face down.
Each player receives 6 letters.
At the signal, all players turn their tiles and try to make crosswords with them.
When a player has used all his letters he says Mixmo
Each player picks two more letters and the game goes on until the all face-down letters are used.
